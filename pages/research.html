                            simultaneous transmit and receive (STAR) communication and radar systems. In this research,
                            our main focus is to address the significant issue of self-interference, a problem often
                            leading to receiver saturation and nonlinearity. To tackle this challenge, we've designed a
                            specialized self-interference cancellation circuit tailored for shared W-band (77-81 GHz)
                            antennas in automotive FMCW radar applications. Our approach encompasses various techniques
                            in antenna and RF domains to effectively reduce self-interference signals through
                            segregating desired and undesired signals into common and differential modes.

                            early detection of various diseases such as sleep disorders. Sleep apnea, a significant
                            sleep disorder, presents challenges due to expensive diagnostic methods. To address this, a
                            novel wireless wearable system has been developed which captures bio-signals and transmits
                            them to a smartphone, allowing for a low-cost sleep apnea diagnosis. The system uses readily
                            available components and records eight signals, including movement and Photoplethysmography
                            (PPG) data. These signals are correlated with vital signs using an advanced signal
                            processing, allowing for an impressive accuracy of 90.2% in apnea and hypopnea events
                            detection. The resulting accuracy is further improved using sensor fusion techniques,
                            reaching 95.1% for total apnea and hypopnea events, and nearly 98% for the Apnea-Hypopnea
                            Index (AHI), maintaining an average reliability rate of approximately 93%.</p>
